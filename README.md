## How to use

When you run the program for the first time it will prompt you to create some files and folders, Make sure the path to these items is correct.
  
  Once you get into the main menu there are your options, use "help <number>" to get more info on each option.

## Backup Folder:
  In your Rain World folder (not Steam one) there should be a new folder called "RWCPsavs" This is where all the saves are stored when not selected. Inside that folder, you
     will find another folder called "backups".
     Each time you run the program it will create a backup with the date (with the format YYYY-MM-DD [HH-MM-SS]) 
    Inside each backup, you can see all your saves.
